        <h1>How to apply to HZ University of Applied Sciences</h1>
        <blockquote>“How can I apply to HZ?” is one of the most frequent questions asked by prospective students. The procedure is not that complicated as it seems like and doesn`t take much time. Because we want to make it even easier than it is already, I created a small guide to help you with the application. If you still have questions, please, don't hesitate to contact one of <a href="https://info.hz.nl/talk-to-an-advisor?_gl=1*17lievn*_ga*MjA2MDI2NjEwLjE2MDEyODU0Njk.*_ga_6MYD4DVW57*MTYxNzgzMDA4Ny41NC4xLjE2MTc4MzEwMTYuMA..&_ga=2.57508650.128604493.1617811151-206026610.1601285469" target="_blank">HZ's student advisors</a> :).</blockquote>
        <h3>THE GUIDE ON HOW TO APPLY TO HZ UNIVERSITY:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>The first step is to access the <a href="https://www.studielink.nl/" target="_blank">Studielink</a>. Go to Login section. Once you have clicked the link within the Login section, you will be redirected to another page.</li>
            <li>Step no. 2 is to apply for a username and password to login to the site. This is possible by clicking the link below the “Log in via Studielink” button.</li>
            <li>Once you have done that, the page where you create the account will open. There you have to fill in your personal details: name, age, nationality, address and so on. Don`t forget to read and approve the general conditions before clicking on “Confirm button” and submit your personal details form.</li>
            <li>The next step is to check your email because Studielink will send you an e-mail with a temporary password (it can take a few minutes until the e-mail appears in your inbox).</li>
            <li>Now, back to the log in page, you can click on “Log in via Studielink” button and register with the username you have just created and the password from the e-mail. It will be requested to change the password using at least 8 characters, both small and capital letters, numbers and symbols.</li>
            <li>On your Studielink page, the first section is called “My To Do List” under which you have two options. Click on “Add previous education” and fill in the information about your previous diploma or the diploma you are going to receive at the end of your current education. After you have done that, return on “My Studielink” page.</li>
            <li>In the same section “My To Do List”, click on “Enrolment application”. There is the place where you select the academic year you will start your studies, the university and programme. Click on “Confirm study programme”, select the starting date and confirm it by clicking on “Confirm starting date”. Tick the confirmation box again and click on “Confirm”.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Now your enrolment application has been submitted. Once you have applied, you will receive an e-mail from HZs administration system. This e-mail will be sent to you within one week from the date of your application on Studielink.</p>
        <p>So as you can see, it is not a big deal. In case the guide above is not sufficient, check the mini-tutorial from down below for a live trial.</p>
        <p>Good luck with your studies!</p>
